1. Minimize Memory Usage

With multipart upload, there’s no need to load the entire file into memory. Instead, you can divide the file into smaller chunks and upload them gradually. This significantly reduces memory usage, especially for files larger than 100 MB.

2. Optimize Network Bandwidth

Multipart upload allows you to manage the size of each chunk to fit your network bandwidth, whether it’s high or low. Smaller parts are less likely to time out or be affected by network issues, ensuring a more reliable upload process.

3. Recover from Upload Failures

If a part fails during the upload process for any reason, you don’t have to start over. Simply re-upload the failed part. This ensures a more fault-tolerant upload experience and saves time.

4. Improve Upload Throughput

The object parts can be uploaded independently in any order. This means you can take advantage of uploading multiple parts simultaneously, either using multi-threading or a distributed system.

5. Pause and Resume Flexibly

Once a multipart upload is initiated, you can upload parts over time without worrying about the process expiring. This flexibility allows you to pause and resume the upload as needed.
